# Systems-and-Networks-I
C Projects created for the Linux OS
<br></br>Project 1 is an actual shell script compared to the simulated one I created in DSAII.  execl() is used to create new processes for users to allow for a script to be run until execution is completed. All native commands (cd/.., ls, pwd, man, cp, etc.) are able to be parsed from the user and executed correctly.  
<br></br>Project 2 uses the multithreading technique to perform the Collatz sequence for a user defined integer n and calculates its total stopping time.
<br></br>Project 3 is an analysis of the page fault problem that exists in virtual computer memory.  It takes a very large array of length n x m and compares the length of time the processor takes to either read or write with each element via horizontal and vertical memory access.
